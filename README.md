### **About:**

Create: Food [Fabric] is an add-on for [Farmer's Delight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight-fabric) based on expanding food content found in [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-fabric), [Farmer's Delight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight-fabric), and vanilla MC. This mod is designed with compatibility in mind, with various features to help integration with other mods.

### **Current Content:**
* 250+ new food-related items. Enable/disable in the config according to preference.
* 30+ new fluids. Enable/disable in the config according to preference.
* New recipes for chocolate & chocolate types.
* All recipes use tags where possible.
* Numerous tag additions to enhance mod compatibility.
* Animated textures for hot drinks.
* Remainder items implemented where applicable (i.e. sticks for popsicles).
* Full recipe support for [satisfy’s [Let’s Do]](https://www.curseforge.com/members/satisfy/projects) mods.
* Tag-based system to apply Farmer's Delight food effects and vanilla status effects. Add Comfort, Nourishment, Night Vision & more to any item with the appropriate tag. Example: 'create:sweet_roll' has been added to the tag 'c:brief_comfort', giving 30 seconds of Comfort.

### **Configuration:**

You might have noticed multiple items featured in this mod can also be found in mods you are already using. I included these items mainly to avoid requiring such mods as dependencies for certain recipes. Therefore, every item/fluid added by this mod can be disabled/enabled through the config, and it is recommended you do so if you are using other mods. The config itself has additional suggestions on which items to disable when using other mods.

Any mod that uses the supported tags can be used. For example, various items found under Farmer’s Delight category in the config can also be crafted with either Croptopia or Candlelight installed.
